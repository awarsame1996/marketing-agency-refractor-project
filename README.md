## Overview

This task is an on-the-job ticketâ€”meaning that i began with starter code that I need to modify.

Refactoring existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular assignment, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

### the challenge

multiple tasks are required in this challenge, which are:

- Make it accessible
- Possibly refactor CSS code
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible
- Include comments
- Make sure the page has a logical structure (title, header, body, footer)
- There should be a logical order to headings (h1->h6)
- Ensure there are alt attributes for all images and keep it descriptive
- Document title (head element) should be descriptive
- Search Engine Optimisation nav link is broken (fix it)
- Remove duplicate class names in CSS and replace with generic class name in HTML

### Screenshot

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

there was not changes to the underlying code so the before and after screenshots of the web page are the same. however, below will be screenshots of the CSS HTML, before and after refactoring.

## My process

the proccess had many steps, which were as followed:

- first i changed the document title (head element) to something more descriptive.
- then i started off by identifying the issue, the HTML and CSS needed refactoring without changing the underlying code.
- so i first started off by changing the HTML to semantic layout, by removing the <divs> and replacing with semantic elements,to make sure the page had a logical structure (title, header, body, footer)
- Then i checked to see if there was a logical order to headings (h1->h6)
- i noticed a lot of repeating codes, as seen in the screenshot so the duplicated code was deleted, generic class names where given for them and the css was refactor more clean.
- Search Engine Optimisation nav link is broken , because it was linked to a id tag that wasn't there. id tag was added.
