### the-challenge

multiple tasks are required in this challenge, which are:

- Use semantic HTML elements where possible
- Include comments
- Make sure the page has a logical structure (title, header, body, footer)
- There should be a logical order to headings (h1->h6)
- Ensure there are alt attributes for all images and keep it descriptive
- Document title (head element) should be descriptive
- Search Engine Optimisation nav link is broken (fix it)
